# Selenium Automation Test by using Python

1. Install dependencies:
- Selenium `pip install selenium`
- Read Excel tools `pip install openpyxl`
- Chrome Driver or any WebDriver you want. In this project, I'm using Chrome Driver.

**Note**
- To add Driver to your code script, follow this line:
`driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=path)` with path is the directory to the .exe driver file
